## Overview

The main task is to create a counter that, with the help of two buttons, allows the user to increase and decrease the counter. Based on this task, the application starts with an adjustable timer that can be configured as a simple timer or a Pomodoro timer.

### The challenge

Main features:

- To decrement or increment the counter (using the +/- buttons, respectively).
- To decrement or increment the timer (using an input that allows the user to directly enter the number).
- To configure the number of cycles that make up a work session.
- To configure the break time between work sessions.
- To display usage data, including the amount of work time, the number of cycles, and the amount of break time.

Extra features:

- Choose from different color themes.
- Select from various skins.
- Access 'help' and tooltips to facilitate the use of the app.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("🎉");
};
```
